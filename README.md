# Image Alignment

Take two similar images as input

<div>
  <img src="photos/1.jpg" alt="Image 1 of building site" width="400" />
  <img src="photos/2.jpg" alt="Image 2 of building site" width="400" /> 
</div>

We can match features of interest on the two images

![Matched features](output/1-2-matches.jpg)

Then transform the second photo to align it with the first

![Aligned image 2](output/2-aligned.jpg)
